EtherCAT (Ethernet for Control Automation Technology) is an Ethernet-based fieldbus system invented by Beckhoff Automation. 
The protocol is standardized in IEC 61158 and is suitable for both hard and soft real-time computing requirements in automation technology. 
The goal during development of EtherCAT was to apply Ethernet for automation applications requiring short data update times (also called cycle times; ≤ 100 μs) with low communication jitter (for precise synchronization purposes; ≤ 1 μs) 
and reduced hardware costs. Typical application fields for EtherCAT are machine controls (e.g. semiconductor tools, metal forming, packaging, injection molding, assembly systems, printing machines, robotics). 
Remote controlled hump yard facilities used in the railroad industry.
Alternative technologies for networking in the industrial environment are EtherNet/IP, Profinet and Profibus.
